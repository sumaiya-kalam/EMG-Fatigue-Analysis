# EMG-Fatigue-Analysis

This project focuses on detecting muscle fatigue using electromyography (EMG) signals collected from multiple subjects. The EMG data is first preprocessed by segmenting it into smaller windows using a sliding window technique. From each window, important time-domain and frequency-domain features such as Root Mean Square (RMS), Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Standard Deviation (STD), Mean Frequency (MNF), and Median Frequency (MDF) are extracted. These features help capture the characteristics of the muscle activity, which are essential for identifying fatigue patterns.

The data are collected from https://github.com/angelineshane/muscle-fatigue/tree/main
